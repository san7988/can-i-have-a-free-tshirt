## The Haiku
Digital Ocean  
Please give me a free tshirt  
Thank You Very Much  

## The Badum Tish
I asked DigitalOcean for a free T-Shirt, but it was a total acid-wash.

## The Paradox
Is a free t-shirt really free if I have to contribute to open source software and make pull requests?

## The Pledge
We, the people creating PRs from this repository, pledge that we will one day make real contributions to Open Source in order to earn the t-shirt. We assure Digital Ocean and GitHub that giving us the t-shirt is therefore truly Utilitarian.

## Back for 2016
Another year, another t-shirt! I've written quite a few open source applications this year.

## Just a final PR
The last PR until next time!

## Making an effort Nonetheless
A free T-shirt will be even a greater source of inspiration for me to make sound contribution to open source.
